## 📝 Overview

Chronic diseases account for over 80% of the global disease burden, yet traditional epidemiological methods are resource-intensive and slow. This project proposes a novel **e-epidemiology framework** that integrates real-time digital health data with causal inference techniques for proactive disease monitoring and intervention.

### 🌟 Key Highlights

- **Real-Time Surveillance:** Leverages daily health-related search data as proxies for disease activity and public concern.
- **Causal Analysis:** Employs vector autoregression (VAR), Granger causality, and impulse response modeling to uncover temporal and causal links.
- **Validation:** Digital signals show strong alignment with traditional epidemiological statistics.
- **Geographical Insights:** Identifies regional variations in medication search patterns.
- **Case Study:** In epilepsy, spikes in related searches precede interest in anxiety, migraine, brain, and heart health.
- **Scalable Framework:** Can be generalized to other chronic diseases and digital data sources.
